	             Class in TypeScript
- Class is a program template in OOP.
- A class contains data and logic which you can customize and implement according to the application requirements.
- Data is present in properties
- Logic is defined in methods.
- Class is an Logical Entity.
- Entity represents some set of members that define the business requirements.
- It contains all members that are required for designing a component.
- Class is a model or blue-print for objects.
- Classes in typescript are created by using "class" keyword
- Class is a template and the rules for class come from a contract.
- Class implements a contract 
- Class is designed by following rules provided by a contract.
- Class will implement the contract by using the keyword "implements"
Syntax:
      class ClassName implement  ContractName
      {
      }
- You can load the members of class into memory by using "new" operator.
  Syntax:
	new className;
- The members loaded into memory are assigned to a reference of refernce of memory called a object.
- Object is a physical representation of its logical entity.
           let object = new ClassName;
           object.Property;
           object.Method();

Ex:
interface IProduct 
{
    Name:string;
    Price:number;
    Quantity:number;
    Total():number;
    Print():void;
}
class Product implements IProduct
{
    Name:string = "TV";
    Price:number = 45000.42;
    Quantity:number = 2;
    Total():number {
        return this.Quantity * this.Price;
    }
    Print():void {
        console.log(`Name=${this.Name}\nPrice=${this.Price}\nQuantity=${this.Quantity}\nTotal=${this.Total()}`);
    }
}
let tv = new Product;
tv.Print();
console.log(`--------------`);
let shoe = new Product;
shoe.Name = "Nike Casuals";
shoe.Price = 3400.44;
shoe.Quantity = 3;
shoe.Print();

Class Members can be restricted in Accessbility
=======================================
- Class in TypeScript have 3 access modifiers for its members.
	a) public
	b) private
	c) protected

public  : 
- It is accessible from any location and by any reference
- you can access within the class
- you can access directly by using an object of the class
- you can access indirectly by using an object of its derived class.

private:
- It is a accessible only within the class.

protected:
- It is accessible within the class.
- It is accessible by using an object of its derived class within the derived class.


Ex:
class Base 
{
    public Id;
    private Name;
    protected Price;
}
class Derived extends Base {
   public Print(obj:Derived){
      obj.Id=1;		// public
      obj.Price = 3000;		// protected
   }
}
