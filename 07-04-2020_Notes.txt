Code Re-usability:
- It is one of the key feature of OOP.
- It is a technique of reusing the code in various components without re-writing.
- In OOP we can handle code reusability by using 2 techniques
	a) Aggregation [Has-A-Relation]
	b) Inheritence  [Is-A-Relation]

Aggregation: 
 - It is a technique of reusing the content of one component in another component without defining any relationship between components.
 - It is defined by using Object-To-Object communication.
 - Technically it is refered as "Has-A-Relation"

Ex:
class SuperClass {
  public Print():void {
    console.log("Super Class Print Method");
  }
}
class DerivedClass {
   public Print():void {
       let obj = new SuperClass();
       obj.Print();
       console.log("Derived Class Print Method");
   }
}
let obj = new DerivedClass();
obj.Print();

Inheritence:
- It is a technique used for extending the functionality of component without disturbing the component core.
- You can extend any component by using Inheritence.
- In order to extend any component you have define a relationship between components.
- When components are having relation then the member of one component can be re-used in another component.
- Without object to object communication you can access members of one component in another.
- This type of relation is know as
	"Is-A-Relation"
- You can extend a component by using "extends" keyword.
   [component : class, enum, interface]
- The existing component is know as "Super" and newly created component that extends existing is know as "Derived".
- The members of Super component are accessible to the derived by using "super" keyword.

Ex:
class SuperClass {
  public Print():void {
    console.log("Super Class Print Method");
  }
}
class DerivedClass extends SuperClass {
   public Print():void {
       super.Print();
       console.log("Derived Class Print Method");
   }
}
let obj = new DerivedClass();
obj.Print();

Extensibility can be defined in several hierarchies:
=========================================
1. Single
2. Multi Level
3. Multiple

Single Inheritence Hierarchy:
- A super class is extended only once.
- It will have one super class and one derived class

Syntax:
   class Super {
   }
   class Derived extends Super {
   }

Multi Level Inheritence Hierarchy:
- A derived class can be extended.
- If a derived class is extened by another derived class then it is reffered as "Multi Level Hierarchy".
- We want every component seperated with functionality according to requirement but are inter connected to each other.

Ex:
class Hardware {
    public Camera:string = "45px";
    public RAM:string = "34GB";
}
class Software extends Hardware {
    public OS:string = "Android";
}
class Mobile extends Software {
    public Name:string = "Samsung";
    public Model:string = "J8";
}
let mob = new Mobile();
console.log(`Name=${mob.Name}\nModel=${mob.Model}\nOS=${mob.OS}\nCamera=${mob.Camera}\nMemory=${mob.RAM}`);

Multiple Hierarchy of Inheritence:
- Single dervied component can extend multiple super components.
- It is not possible in case of classes.
- It is possible for Interfaces.
