Special Operators in Angular
1. Ternary Operator [ ?: ]
2. typeof
3. instanceof
4. delete
5. in  

5. "in" operator :
     ============
 It is used to verify whether the given property in present in an object.

 It returns boolean true or false. It property is present then it returns true else it returns false.

Syntax:
              "PropertyName"  in  ObjectName

Ex:
let prod:any = {
    Name: "TV",
    Price: 45000.55
};
console.log("Is Stock Available in Prod object : " + ("Stock" in prod));
console.log("Is Price Available in Prod object : " + ("Price" in prod));


You can use the in operator over an iteration to read all properties of an object.

Ex:
let prod:any = {
    Name: "TV",
    Price: 45000.55,
    IsInStock:true
};
for(var property in prod) {
    console.log(property + ":" + prod[property]);
}

for..in  : It is used to create an iterator that can read
              all properties of an object.

6. "of" operator :  The of operator is used to verify and read values from a collection over an iteration.

Ex:
let normalArray:string[] = ["TV","Shoe"];
let jsonArray:any[] = [
    {Name: "TV", Price: 45000.55},
    {Name: "Shoe", Price:2400.55}
];
for(var values of normalArray) {
    console.log(values);
}
for(var products of jsonArray) {
    console.log(products);
}

Summary:
  in - for reading properties
  of - for reading values 

7. new  operator:
    It is a special operator that allocates memory dynamically for a class in order to load its members into memory.
    It is know as Dynamic Memory allocating operator.
    It allocates a new memory every time.

Ex:
let now:any = new Date();
console.log(now.toLocaleDateString());
let collection:any[] = new Array();
console.log(collection.length);

Special Operators:
- ternary
- in
- of
- typeof 
- instanceof
- new
- delete

Types of Statements:
 A statement is an program instruction used to control the execution flow.
 The statements are classified into following types

 1. Selection Statements
      if, else, switch, case, default
 2. Iteration and Looping Statements
      for, while, do while
 3. Jump Statements
      break, continue, return
 4. Exception Handling Statements
      try, catch, throw, finally

	       TypeScript  OOP
- In real world applicaition development we use 3 major programming systems
	a) POPS [Process Oriented Programming]
	b) OBPS [Object Based Programming]
	c) OOPS [Object Oriented Programming]


POPS:
- It supports low level features.
- It can directly interact with hardware services.
- It is faster
- It needs very less memory to operate.

DrawBacks:
- Code reusability issues
- Code speration issues
- No  dynamic memory allocation.

Ex:  C, PASCAL, COBOL


OBPS:
- It supports re-usability but by using objects
- It supports dynamic memory allocation
- It can embeded into existing applications

DrawBacks:
- Code Extensibility issues
- Less Secured
- No Dynamic Polymorphism.

Ex:  JavaScript, Visual Basic [VB]


OOPS: Object Oriented Programming System
- Object was introduced into computer programming in early 1950's by "Alan Kay".
- Object contains data and logic.
- Data is present in properties.
- Logic is present in methods.
- In ealy 1960's "Johan Olay & Kristian Nygaard" introduced re-usability of object by inventing a concept called class. 
- Class is an entity that contains logic and data which can be access and used from objects.
- The first OOP language was "SIMULA 67" introduced by Johan Olay and Kristian Nygaard
- Object Oriented Programming started with "Code-Reusability".
- In early 1970's "Trygve" introduced a new framework for computer programming called "MVC"
- It supports code re-usability and seperation.
	M	- Model  - Data
	V	- View    - UI
	C	- Controller - Logic
- Every technology is using MVC framework
     Java		Spring
     PHP		Cake PHP, Code Igniter
     Perl		Catalyst, Dancer
     Python		Django, Flask, Grock
     Ruby		Ruby on Rails
     .NET		ASP.NET MVC
     JavaScript	SPINE, Angular JS
- It was first formulated with a language called
	"Small Talk"

Features of OOP:
- Code reusability
- Code speration
- Code Extensibility
- Loosely coupled
- Maintainability
- Testability

DrawBacks of OOP:
- It will not support low level features
- It can't directly interact with hardware services
- It requires more memory
- It is slow
- It is more complex in configuration.

Characterstics of OOP:
1. Class
2. Object
3. Inheritence
4. Polymorphism
5. Encapsulation
6. Abstraction
