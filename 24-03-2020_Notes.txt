	        Contracts in OOP
- In real world development process to design any component we have to follow certain rules.
- Every component is designed as per specified rules.
- In Object Oriented Programming the rules are defined by using a contract.
- In OOP "Interface" is known as contract.
- Interface is a contract which defines a set of rules for designing any component.
- Interface is a contract designed by using "interface" keyword
  Syntax:
               interface Iname 
               {
                  //rules
               }
- Rules in interface are nothing but "Properties" and "Methods".
- Properties are defined as rule for storing data.
- Methods are defined as rule for defining functionality.
- Interface contains rules for data and functionality.
- Interface rules are by default public in access. You should not define any access modifier like : public, private, protected.
- Interface rules must contain only declaration. No initialization and no-rendering or assigning of value.
- Rules can't contain definition or value.
- Properties requires value.
- Methods require definition.
- Properties and Methods in an interface should not contain value or definition.

Syntax:
               interface  Iname 
               {
                   propertyName:DataType; 
                   methodName():returnType;
               }
               interface IName {
	 propertyName:dataType = 10; // invalid
                   methodName():returnType 
                   {                                                  // invalid
                    }
               }

Ex:
interface IProduct
{
   ProductId:number;
   Name:string;
   Price:number;
   IsInStock:boolean;
}
let product:IProduct = {
    ProductId:1,
    Name: "Samsung TV",
    Price: 45000.53,
    IsInStock: true
}
console.log(`Id=${product.ProductId} \n Name=${product.Name}\n Price=${product.Price}\n InStock=${product.IsInStock}`)
