Static and Non-Static [dynamic] Members

- The terms "static" and "dynamic" are related to memory.
- Static memory
- Dynamic memory

Static:
- It refers to static memory.
- Static memory is continous memory.
- The memory allocated for first object will be  continued for other objects.
- In Type script static members are defined by using the keyword "static".
- The static members are accessed within the class or outside the class by using class name.
- Static occupies more memory.
- Static members can't be safe as they are still in memory.

Syntax:
	class Demo {
	     static s = 0;
	}
	Demo.s;

Non-Static [Dynamic]:
- It refers to dynamic memory.
- It is discreet memory, not continous memory.
- The memory allocated for first object will reset after the object finished using memory.
- Everytime memory is newly allocated.
- By default all members in a class are non-static.
- You can access non-static member within the class by using "this" keyword and outside the class by using any object reference.
- It leads to round-trips as memory need to be allocated everytime newly.
- This will effect in the perfomance of application.

Syntax:
	class Demo {
	      n=0;
	      this.n;
	}
	let obj = new Demo;
	obj.n

Ex:
class Demo
{
    public static s=0;
    public n=0;
    constructor(){
        Demo.s = Demo.s + 1;
        this.n = this.n + 1;
    }
    public Print():void {
        console.log(`s=${Demo.s} n=${this.n}`);
    }
}
let obj1 = new Demo;
obj1.Print();
let obj2 = new Demo;
obj2.Print();
let obj3 = new Demo;
obj3.Print();
