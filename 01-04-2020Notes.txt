- Multiple constructor implementations are not allowed in a class.
- Constructor can't overload.

2. Properties: 
- Properties in a class are used to store data.
- You can restrict the accessibility of property by using access modifiers.
- A property can be static or non-static.

Syntax:
   accessModifier  propertyName:dataType = value;
Ex:
   public  Name:string;
   this.Name="TV";

   public static Id:number = 1;
   ClassName.Id;

- Every property you defined in a class can be rendered with a new value.
- You can restrict by using "readonly".
- A property can be readonly. It will not allow to re-define the value.

Ex:
class Sample {
    public static id:number=1;
    public name:string = "TV";
    public readonly price:number = 40000.44;
}
let obj = new Sample;
Sample.id = 101;
obj.name = "Samsung TV";
console.log(`Id=${Sample.id}\nName=${obj.name}\nPrice=${obj.price}`);

3. Accessors
- TypeScript supports getters/setters as a way of intercepting accessess to a member of an object.
- Accessors will give more control over the property so that we can set or set value.
- Accessors are defined by using "get" and "set".
- Accessors will give more control over property so that you can even authorize properties.
- Authorizing is restricting accessibility to only specific type of users or specific state.

Syntax:
    public property:type;
    get  propertyName() {
           return this.property;
    }
    set  propertyName(newValue:type) {
            this.property = newValue;
    }  

Ex:
let username:string = "admin";
let password:string = "admin123";
class Student {
    public name:string = "John";
    public course:string = "Angular"; 
    //accessor
    get courseName():string {
        return this.course;
    }
    set courseName(newCourseName:string){
        if(username=="admin" && password=="admin123") {
            this.course = newCourseName;
        } else {
            console.log("Error: User is not authorized to Update Course");
        }
    }
}
let student = new Student();
student.name = "David";
student.courseName = "React JS";
console.log(`Name=${student.name}\nCourse=${student.courseName}`); 

Note : Try changing the user name and password. If it is not matching the required user name and password, then it will use the default course "angular".
