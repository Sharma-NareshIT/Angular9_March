Type assertions
- Same like type convertions in other languages
- Converting one type into another.
- It is like in other languages "Type Casting"
- Type assertions are required to tell the compiler that we exaclty know what type of data we are dealing with.
- Developers usually use type assertions to tell compiler about the data type. 
- Two ways of using type assertions
	a) by using generic type represention with
	      angle bracket < >
	b) by using "as" key word

Generic Type Assertion using angle bracket:
====================================
- Define the datatype in < > angle bracket
- followed by the variable that contains value.

 Syntax:
	(<string> variableName)
	(<number> variableName)
	(<boolean> variableName)

Ex:
let msg:any = "Welcome to TypeScript";

let count:number = (<string>msg).length;

console.log("Total No of Chars : " + count);

Type assertion by using "as"  Keyword:
================================
- Define the data type for variable by using "as" keyword.
- VariableName "as" DataTypeName

Syntax:
	(variableName as dataTypeName)

Ex:
let msg:any = "Welcome to TypeScript Tutorial";

let count:number = (msg as string).length;

console.log("Total No of Chars : " + count);

Note: We often use "as" for type assertion specially when we are working with  JSX. JavaScript Asynchronous Requests.

	      Operators in Type Script
- Operator is an object in computer programming.
- Object contains data and functionality.
- Operator is an object that evaluates a value and returns the value.
- Operator access data in operands and perform any specific functionality.
	           x  +  y
              x and y  are operands that contain data
              + is an operator that evalues an value and
	returns the value.
- Based on how many operands an operator an handle, the operators are majorly classified into
	a) Unary Operator
	          - it uses one operand
	          ex:  x++
	b) Binary Operator
	          - it uses two operand
	          ex: x + y
	c) Ternary Operator
	          - It uses three operands
	          ex:
		(condition)?true:false
- Based on what type of value an operator returns the operators are classified into following types.
	Number	- Arithematic Operator
	Boolean	- Logical, Relational
	Binary	- Bitwise Operators

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparison (Relational) Operators
3. Bitwise Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Assignment Operators
6. Special Operators


	Special Operators in TypeScript

1. Ternary Operator  ( ?: )
    - It uses an expression and return values based on boolean result i.e true or false.
    - It is similar to "if..else"

  Syntax:
        (boolExpression)?value_true:value_false

Ex:
let isInStock:boolean = false;
console.log(`Stock Status : ${(isInStock==true)?"Available":"Out of Stock"}`);

2. delete operator
   - It is used to delete any property of an object.
   - You can't delete if property is readonly.

 Syntax:
              delete  objectName.Property;

Ex:
let product:any = {
    Name: "Samsung TV",
    Price: 45000.55
};
delete product.Price;
console.log(`Name=${product.Name} \n Price=${product.Price}`);

FAQ:
         delete  Math.PI ;            // invalid  Math is a built
		                in object and all 			properties of buit in
			object are readonly.

3. instanceof  operator [true or false]

  - It is used to verify the class from where the object is derived from.
  - It returns true or false
  - It returns true if it is derived from specified class.

Syntax:
            (objectName  instanceof  className)

Ex:
class Employee {

}
let emp:any = new Employee();
let products:any = new Array();

console.log(`Emp is an Array : ${(emp instanceof Array)}`);
console.log(`Emp is an Employee : ${(emp instanceof Employee)}`);
console.log(`Products is an Array : ${(products instanceof Array)}`);
console.log(`Products is an Employee : ${(products instanceof Employee)}`);

4. typeof  operator
    - It is used to identify the datatype of any reference.
    - It returns the data type of value present in a
      reference.

Ex:
let obj:any = {
    Name : "TV",
    Price: 45000.42,
    InStock:true
};
console.log(`Name is ${(typeof obj.Name)} type`);
console.log(`Price is ${(typeof obj.Price)} type`);
console.log(`InStock is ${(typeof obj.InStock)} type`);
