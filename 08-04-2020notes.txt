Multiple Inheritence
- Single derived component can extend multiple super components.
- It is supported only for Interface i.e contracts.
- It is not supported for classes.

FAQ : Why Multiple Inheritence not supported for classes?
A: It is due to "Dead Locks" caused by constructor.

- In OOP everytime first super class constructor is called then followed by derived class constructor. It is mandatory to do so.
  Error:
 "Constructors for derived classes must contain a 'super' call"

- You can call the super class constructor before the derived class constructor by using "super()" inside derived class constructor.

Ex:
class Super {
    constructor(){
        console.log("Super Class Constructor");
    }
}
class Derived extends Super {
    constructor(){ 
        super();	// call for super class constructor
        console.log("Dervied Class Constructor");
    }
}
let obj = new Derived();

- You can't extend classes using multiple hierarchy.

 Syntax:
    class  super1 {
    }
   class super2 { 
    }
   class derived extends super1, super2 {  // invalid
   }

- You can implement classes using multiple hierarchy.

 Syntax:
    class  super1 {
    }
   class super2 { 
    }
   class derived implements super1, super2 {  // valid
   }

- Implementing  is configuring the rules hence a class can implement multiple contracts. but can't extend.

What is inheritence and what is implementation?
- inheritence is extensibility.        [extends]
- implementation is adaptability. [implements]

Multiple hierarchy of extensibility is not supported for class. 
Multiple hierarchy of adaptibility is supported for class.
