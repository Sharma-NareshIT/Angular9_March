Polymorphism
Task : 
- Create a method that can accept parameters
	Method() { printing value }
	Method(a, b) { addition of values } 
- Create a Method that single can perform all mathematical operations like
	add, sub, mul, div
	Method(a,b,..)   add, sub, mul
  you can pass parameter and operation type so that it will perform that operation on those parameters.
	Method(10,20, add) { } 

	       Templates in OOP
- Template comprises of sample design with some sample data which you can customize according to your requirements.
- A developer needs to design templates for client so that he can implement according his requirements.
- What is a template in software development, how templates are designed? 
- Abstract Class
- Abstract class is a class that comprises of functionalities both implemented and not-implemented i.e just defined.
- Technically a class should have all members functionality implemented.
- It any functionality is not-implemented then it should be designated as "Abstract Class".
- Abstract classes are defined by using "abstract"
- Abstract class can contain both incomplete and complete methods.
- The incomplete methods must be defined as "abstract".
- You can create an object for incomplete classes i.e you can create an object for abstract class.
- You have to create a new class where you can implement the pending functionality.
- You can "implement" an abstract class and define all the funcitonalities or You can "extend" an abstract class where you can define and extend functionalities.
- If any member in the class is abstract then it is mandatory to define the class as abstract class.

What is difference between a contract and template?
- Contract is Interface
- Contract can contain only declaration not definition.
- You can't define access sepcifiers for contract members.

- Template is Abstract Class
- Template can contain both declaration and definition.
- Template contains both empty method without definition and methods with definition.
- You can define access specifiers.

- Can we have private method in abstract class?
  Yes but you can access only within the class it is not suitable for extensibility.

- When you are using abstract members in a class the implementation details are hidden from the user. only functionality will be provided through an implemented class. The mechanism of hiding the members in a class and providing implementation for those members is known as "Abstraction"

- Abstraction can be acheived in OOP by using "Abstract classes and Interfaces".

Ex:
abstract class Product {
    public Id:number;
    public Name:string;
    public Price:number;
    public Qty:number;
    public abstract Total():number;
    public Print():void {
        console.log(`Id=${this.Id}\nName=${this.Name}\n${this.Price}\nQty=${this.Qty}\nTotal=${this.Total()}`);
    }
}
class TV extends Product {
    public Id:number = 1;
    public Name:string = "Samsung TV";
    public Price:number = 45000.55;
    public Qty:number = 4;
    public Total():number {
        return this.Qty * this.Price;
    }
    public Print():void {
        super.Print();
    }
}
let tv = new TV();
tv.Print();
