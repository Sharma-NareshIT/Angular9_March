Access Modifiers
Static and Non Static Members
	
	   Members in a Class
A class in TypeScript OOP comprises of following members:
1. Constructor
2. Properties
3. Methods
4. Accessors

Constructor:
==========
- It is a special type of method in a class. In JavaScript terminology its is a special type of function.
- A general method is explicit, you have to call the method in order to execute and return functionality.
- A constructor method is implicit, it executes 
automatically.
- Constructor loads into memory when ever the memory allocated for class and excutes automatically.
- When we want any functionality to perform implicitly every time without manually calling it, then define the functionality using constructor.
- Every class is having an implicit constructor, which is also called as default constructor. A constructor is defined internally for every class.
- Default constructor usually identifies the type and initializes default value into those types.

	public price:number;
	console.log(price);       // undefined
			       [constructor]
- You can create an explicit constructor to defines the tasks to be peformed automatically.
- TypeScript constructor is created by using the keyword "constructor".
- Constructor methods are anonymous methods hence a name is not required. Usually the class name is used for constructor name implicitly.

Syntax:
	class  ClassName
	{
	   constructor()
	   {
	   }
	}
	let  obj = new ClassName();  

	 ()-> to pass params into constructor

- Every constructor method is by default public in access.
- Every constructor method executes only once for an object.

Ex:
class Database {
     constructor(){
        console.log("Connected to Database..");
    }
    public Insert():void {
        console.log("Record Inserted");
    }
    public Delete():void {
        console.log("Record Deleted");
    }
}
let oracle = new Database;
oracle.Insert();
oracle.Delete();
let mysql = new Database;
mysql.Delete();
mysql.Insert();

- Constructor can be parameter less or parameterized.
- If constructor is parameterized then we have to pass values into parameter while allocating memory for class.
           let obj = new className(param);
- If constructor parameter is optional parameter then you can ignore the parameters while allocating memory.

Ex:
class Database {
     constructor(dbname: string){
        console.log(`Connected to ${dbname} Database..`);
    }
    public Insert():void {
        console.log("Record Inserted");
    }
    public Delete():void {
        console.log("Record Deleted");
    }
}
let oracle = new Database("Oracle");
oracle.Insert();
oracle.Delete();
let mysql = new Database("MySql");
mysql.Delete();
mysql.Insert();
